# This a Lite version of Py6S code



* Only the basic functions of the Py6S are retained, including creating input files, running, and receiving simulation results.
* Add "sixs_plus.py" file, a SixSPlus class used to create a 6S simulation outputs variable dictionary.
* The original py6s only works with 6SV1.1, a small amount of corrections have been made to the source code so that it can also run the 6S scalar verison 4.1.

# Modification

* Add "\MyTests" path for all test .py or .ipynb script
* The original py6S works only with 6S V1.1, but I use 6S v4.1. I have to hide the SISVERSION check line ( line 392 - 393) in sixs.py to make available for v4.1. Up to now,  I found that the outputs.py works with the v4.1 output files,.

# Todo list

* Finish  all types of simulation with 6S v4.1, verify if py6S.outputs can load correctly all outputs.
